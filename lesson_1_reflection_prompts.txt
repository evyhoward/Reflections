How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It shows changes between version.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a better
programmer in the long term?

    Gives me a history of my changes.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
    
    I have better control on when it is time to create a new version. It's more logical than random.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    A particular bug fix may affect one or more files.  It makes more sense to commit files that were affected in fixing a particular problem.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
    
    git log provides history of changes. git diff provides changes maded between versions.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
    
    I can always go back to the version that works prior to me breaking the code.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Create a repository for my code set.
